# Upgrade

The only required piece to be regularly upgraded is our CLI.


## Upgrade your CLI

The CLI, which is a regular NPM package, can be upgraded with:

    npm i -g openode

## Legacy

From January 2021, we are launching opeNode v3, see the [upgrade note](/docs/installation/legacy_upgrade.md).
