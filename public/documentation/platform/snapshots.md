# Snapshots

Snapshots allow to retrieve files in your live instance for backup purpose. Once created, a URL is provided so that you can download the archive. Snapshots expire after a certain interval (hours) and so you need to take care to backup them.

## Using the Administration Dashboard

The snapshot feature is available in the administration, under Access > Snapshots, which is the most convenient to manage snapshots.

## Using the CLI

The following command can be used to create a snapshot:

    openode create-snapshot
